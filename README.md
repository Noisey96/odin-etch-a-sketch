# odin-etch-a-sketch

My version of TOP's Project: Etch-a-Sketch. You can find the directions I followed to create the basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)!

## What?

This project is to create a webpage that mimics an Etch a Sketch. This project has one HTML file, one CSS file, and one JavaScript file. The JavaScript file builds the grid and allows the settings to function as expected.

## Why?

This project exists to show the basics of manipulating the DOM and of user interaction with JavaScript.
